# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
Power Bi Dashboard
Project Objective: The objective of the credit card dashboard is to provide real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations 
                   effectively. 
Datasets: credit_card.csv and customer.csv
Insights: 1) Revenue Analysis: Analyzed revenue generated from credit card fees and interest charges, providing a clear picture of the financial health of the credit card portfolio.
          2) Spending Patterns: Analyzed spending categories (e.g., groceries, travel, entertainment) to determine where customers are spending the most. This can inform targeted marketing campaigns and partnership 
                                opportunities.
          3) Transaction Trends: Identified peak transaction times and days, helping to understand when credit card usage is highest. This can aid in optimizing processing resources and customer service staffing.
          4) Delinquency Rates: Monitored the percentage of overdue accounts and identified trends or risk factors associated with late payments. This insight helps in managing credit risk and implementing 
                                proactive measures.
          5) Geographical Analysis: Identified the states of America with high credit card usage. This can help in identifying potential markets for expansion or areas requiring more focused security measures.
